# monstercat-visualizer
An realtime audio visualizer for Rainmeter similar to the used ones in the Monstercat videos.
Supports all major media players (AIMP, iTunes, Winamp, VLC, etc...) and full Spotify support (thanks to .raptor for the Spotify plugin).

#### Minimum Requirements:
 - Windows Vista
 - Rainmeter 3.3 (4.0 Beta recommended)

#### Features

- Live visualization of the audio output
- Customizable colors and fonts
- Genre-based colors (AIMP, CAD, iTunes, WMP and Winamp)
- Cover-based colors (All supported players)
- Support for all mayor media players
- Full Spotify support
- Media controls
- Settings skin for easier customization/configuration
- Hide skin when media player is not running

#### Important notes


- You need at least Rainmeter 3.3 or higher to get all features of this skin. You can find the newest version on rainmeter.net
- After installation you can access the settings by right-clicking the visualizer or song information and then clicking on Open Settings.
- Due to limitations of Rainmeter/the plugin used for the visualization the complete audio output of your system will be shown on the visualizer. For the best experience only play music. This is something I can’t fix.

#### Installation


**1.** Download the skin at **http://adf.ly/1f56j9**, in the releases section in this repo or just clone it.

**2.** Install the skin by double-clicking the .rmskin file.

**3.** After that the setup skin will appear and there you can set all the important settings.
